# Grappa

An app to speed up and simplify the process of getting one's thesis approved. Made for the Helsinki University's department of Computer Science.

The front-end is made with React + Redux + Webpack + coffee. It builds into "dist"-folder and is easily configurable. The detailed instructions how this project works will be added once we are wise enough to tell you.

But basically you just add React components to the src-folder and then they are automatically rendered onto your view on localhost:8080.
